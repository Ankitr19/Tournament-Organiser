# Tournament-Organiser
A Swiss-system tournament organiser

This is a PostgreSQL database realted project. The main motive behind this project is to understand the working of the PSQL database, and also how to
control the database using the Python DB-API.

The project is all about a tournament based upon the Swiss-system tournament organiser. The python code manipulates all the database in the tournament.sql file.
And the tournament_test.py file is for testing the code.
